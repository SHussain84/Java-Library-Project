# Java-Library-Project
A project in Java using object oriented programming (OOP) in order to model a University library system.

The model contains classes which represent materials within the library as well as users of the library and library staff.

A basic summary of each Java file:

* [Library.java](https://github.com/SHussain84/Java-Library-Project/blob/main/Library.java) is the foundation to the project - it contains the data structures which house the library items, users, diary and item reservations. This file also contains most of the read and write methods. [Library.java](https://github.com/SHussain84/Java-Library-Project/blob/main/Library.java) utilises scanner objects in order to read through multiple files located in [data](https://github.com/SHussain84/Java-Library-Project/tree/main/data) and store the corresponding data into the appropriate data structures. 
* [LibraryItem.java](https://github.com/SHussain84/Java-Library-Project/blob/main/LibraryItem.java)
